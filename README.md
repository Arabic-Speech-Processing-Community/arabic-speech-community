Arabic Speech Processing Community

ðŸ”¹ Mission

This community brings together researchers, developers, and educators working on Arabic speech recognition, processing, and mispronunciation detection.
Our goal is to provide open-source tools, datasets, benchmarks, and models to advance Arabic speech technologies across Modern Standard Arabic, Classical Arabic (Qurâ€™anic), and dialects.

ðŸ”¹ Why This Community?

Arabic is the fifth most spoken language in the world, yet it remains underrepresented in speech technologies.
Key challenges include:

Dialectal diversity

Limited annotated speech corpora

Scarcity of mispronunciation detection datasets

Fragmented research resources

This initiative creates a central hub on GitHub and Hugging Face where contributors can share datasets, tools, models, and benchmarks openly.
